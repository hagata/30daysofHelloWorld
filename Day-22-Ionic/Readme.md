# Ionic2 native app
Ionic2, Angular 2 + Typescript project.

Built with:
```
    ionic start maf-calc blank --v2 --ts
```

# Github Repo Finder (the tutorial)
To get the hang of building a simple project, I followed the [Building A2, Ionic2 app tutorial](http://gonehybrid.com/build-your-first-mobile-app-with-ionic-2-angular-2-part-5/). Some of the Ionic API has changed since the publishing of the tutorial. Up to date info from the Ionic Docs helped fill in the gaps.
